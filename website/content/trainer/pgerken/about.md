# Patrick Gerken

Patrick is long time software [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) developer how tried very long to avoid [Plone](https://plone.org) to work with everything else [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) based.

After there wasn't much non [Plone](https://plone.org) development left in Zope land he got thoroughly introduced to [Plone](https://plone.org) at [Syslab](https://www.syslab.com/homepage/) and [Starzel.de](http://starzel.de).

At the later company he got tricked by Philip into co-writing the comprehensive [Training](https://training.plone.org) manual we have now.

Patrick now lives in beautiful Austria and hasn't given many trainings lately.

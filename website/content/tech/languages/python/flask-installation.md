# Flask installation

Flask is a web microframework for Python -- simpler than [Django](/tech/languages/python/django-installation.html), yet just as capable. Check out [the documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) if you want to learn more.

To install Flask on Fedora:

For Python 2:

```
$ sudo dnf install python-flask
```

For Python 3:

```
$ sudo dnf install python3-flask
```

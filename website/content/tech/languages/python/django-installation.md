# Django installation

Django is one of the most popular high-level web frameworks. It is, along with [Flask](/tech/languages/python/flask-installation.html), your best bet if you want to try some web development. [The documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/) is first class, too!

To install Django on Fedora:

For Python 2:

```
$ sudo dnf install python-django
```

For Python 3:

```
$ sudo dnf install python3-django
```

Theme Settings
==============

Our theme is based on the `Hugo Universal Theme <https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme>`_.

We adjusted the CSS to give it more a `Plone <https://plone.org>`_ look like and we modified various params and HTML templates.

Please read the `Universal Theme Docs <https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme>`_ to find out more about possible configuration settings.

Features
--------

Currently we use *features* to show our training overview.
